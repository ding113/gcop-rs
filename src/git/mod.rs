/// - Pure Rust interface, independent of concrete backend implementation.
/// - Supports mocking in tests (via `mockall`).
/// - Uses unified error handling via [`GcopError`](crate::error::GcopError).
///
/// # Example
/// ```no_run
/// use gcop_rs::git::{GitOperations, repository::GitRepository};
///
/// # fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
/// let repo = GitRepository::open(None)?;
/// let diff = repo.get_staged_diff()?;
